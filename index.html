            <span>Lionel Andrés Messi </span>also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays
            as a forward for
            and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as
            one
            of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record
            six
            European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in
            2021,
            he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies,
            including
            ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his
            country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative
            playmaker,
            Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA
            Champions
            League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most
            international
            goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country,
            and
            has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).
            Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut
            aged
            17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years,
            and
            in his first uninterrupted season in 2008 2009 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish
            football;
            that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning
            four
            consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011 2012
            season,
            he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself
            as
            Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind
            Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014 15 campaign,
            becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which
            he
            was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015.
